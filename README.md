# Test Resource Pack

Here is a little resource pack to see the structure and how custom models are made using a resource pack

It is designed for Minecraft version 1.9-latest. If you get a warning and you are using 1.9+, ignore it. When you enable the resource pack and you give yourself an unbreakable diamond hoe with a durability of 1, you should get a cube. That's the custom item. It's easier to get the item with the Spigot API, but it is possible with commands.
